            <p>

            <p>
              Wondering whether to buy a used book or a new one? Used books are often more affordable and environmentally friendly,
              while new books come in pristine condition with no prior markings. Choose based on your preference and budget.

              It stands for International Standard Book Number. This 10 or 13-digit number identifies the edition.
